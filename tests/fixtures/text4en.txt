Navigation, the art of charting courses on vast oceans, is a dance with the waves. Ships, like modern-day nomads, traverse the open seas, guided by stars and instruments. Navigators, the poets of the maritime, read the language of tides and winds. Each journey is a narrative etched on the world's waters, an exploration of the unknown. The compass becomes a storyteller, pointing the way to distant shores. In the vastness of the sea, navigation is a dialogue between sailors and the endless horizon, a testament to humanity's enduring quest for discovery.
